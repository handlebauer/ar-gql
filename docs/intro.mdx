# Introduction

## Why am I here?

You're in the right place if you're a developer interested in leveraging [Arweave GraphQL endpoints](reference/endpoints). GraphQL endpoints remain the most robust method of retrieving both transaction and block metadata from the larger [Arweave network](https://arwiki.arweave.dev). This guide is intended as a reference for those curious to learn more about how to best integrate Arweave GraphQL endpoints into their workflows.

## Do I really need this?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn) is a "query language for APIs" which provides "the power to ask for exactly what [you] need and nothing more".

In our case, Arweave nodes are responsible for ingesting and replicating blocks across the network, each block comprising 1+ transactions. Importantly, metadata is embedded alongside each and every block/transaction.

**Arweave GraphQL endpoints, it can be concluded, act as APIs that allow you, the developer, to ask for as much or little metadata relating to blocks and transactions as necessary.**

All of this is indispensable on the way to answering critical questions during development:
- Given its ID, who is the owner of this transaction?
- Which transaction IDs are associated with these specific transaction tags?
- Of these transaction's IDs, how many have > 10 confirmations?

## Now what?

If you already know what you're doing, there are handy references for [transaction fields](#), [block fields](#), and the [full schema](#).
