# Getting Started

## First things first

### What are you after?

As with all programming, you're on the hunt for a desired output. Implied in this, is possession over certain inputs.

Let's assume you're using [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io) to log users into your new dApp. Once a user has authenticated, you'll have access to their wallet address (public key).

Now, let's say you want to display the last 10 transaction they made using your dApp.

In this case, your input is the user's wallet address (as well as your dApp's `App-Name` tag), and the desired output is 10 transaction IDs.

### Working backwards 

Using our example, let's set out to satisfy our objective by working backwards:

1. Start by identifying desired outputs (transaction IDs)
2. Find the appropriate [transaction queries](query/transactions) given your input (in our case, [owner](query/transactions/owner) and [transaction tags](query/transactions/by-tag))
3. Write and execute your query

## Real-world example

### Assumptions

- You have node (>= v16.17.0) installed
- You enabled esm (`"type": "module"`) in your `package.json`
- You ran `npm i node-fetch`

### Executing your first query

```js title="project/index.js"
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

const owner = 'ZaMsGtl6jiJG9rJvTBK5nXil5WNREg498FTP37HYabk'
const appName = 'ArGQL-Test'

const query = `
  query {
    transactions(
      owners: "${owner}"
      tags: [{ name: "App-Name", values: "${appName}" }]
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

const url = 'https://arweave.net/graphql'
const init = {
  method: 'post',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
}

const { data } = await fetch(url, init).then(response => response.json())

/** console.log(data)
  {
    transactions: {
      edges: [
        [Object], [Object],
        [Object], [Object],
        [Object], [Object],
        [Object], [Object],
        [Object], [Object]
      ]
    }
  }
 */

/** @type {string[]} */
const transactionIds = data.transactions.edges.map(edge => edge.node.id)
```

:::tip
The above fetches only the transaction IDs. See [arweave-js](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js) on the subject of fetching the actual transaction data.
