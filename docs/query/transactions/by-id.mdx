## How to find transaction metadata by ID

You may retrieve metadata for one or more transactions by specifying their IDs in an array:

:::tip
Omitting the square brackets is permissible if you specify only one ID
:::

```graphql
query {
    transactions(ids: ["G-1t0Lqysin897HC3IV8xu_Mr884B-Mo5YEnlhUH54k"]) {
        edges {
            node {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
```
