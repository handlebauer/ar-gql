## Find transactions by blockheight

If you wish to retrieve transactions from given block numbers, you may specify a block height range. The following is an example of how to retrieve all transaction IDs from the genesis block to block #10.

```graphql
query {
    transactions(block: { min: 0, max: 10 }) {
        edges {
            node {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
```
