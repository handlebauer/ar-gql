## How to find transaction metadata by recipient

You may retrieve metadata for one or more transactions by specifying recipient address(es) in an array:

:::tip
Omitting the square brackets is permissible if you specify only one recipient
:::

```graphql
query {
    transactions(recipients:["M6w588ZkR8SVFdPkNXdBy4sqbMN0Y3F8ZJUWm2WCm8M"]) {
        edges {
            node {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
```
