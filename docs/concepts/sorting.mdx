title: Sorting
---

You may wish to sort your result set by blockheight (that is, temporally).

This can be achieved by setting the `sort` enum to one of the following:

- `HEIGHT_ASC` orders results in ascending order (oldest first) 
- `HEIGHT_DESC` orders results in descending order (newest first)

:::tip
`HEIGHT_ASC` is implied; in other words, you need only specify `HEIGHT_DESC` when needed
:::

```graphql
query {
    transactions(sort: HEIGHT_DESC) {
        edges {
            node {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
```
