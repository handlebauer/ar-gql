You can control the number of results returned per page by using the `first` argument:

```graphql
query {
    transactions(
        tags: [{ name: "App-Name", values: "ArGQL-Test" }]
        first: 100 # <—— between 1-100 (gateway-dependent)
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
```
