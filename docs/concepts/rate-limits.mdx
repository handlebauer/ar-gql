Rate-limits are variable and dependent on the [gateway provider](/resources/endpoints).

## [ar.io](https://ar.io)

### Overview

Rate-limits for ar.io's gateways are as follows:

- GraphQL endpoint ([/graphql](https://arweave.net/graphql)): **600 requests** per **5 minutes**

Once rate-limit are exceeded, the requesting IP is issued a 5 minute cool-down period.
